Data Structure
----------------
organising data in a structured way
types
--------
1.LinkedList
2.Stack
3.Queue
4.Deque

LinkedList
---------------
1. A linked list is a linear data structure, 
        in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

2. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a 
        data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

*.The data field contains the data
*.the link field contains the reference to the next node.
*. the link field contains the reference to the previous node.

_p__|__d__|__n_|-----  |__p__|___d__|_n|
operations
------------
1. Traverse---displays each element in forward direction
2. appending elements to the  LinkedList
3. inserting new element into the LinkedList
4. remove an element from the LinkedList
5. replace one element with another
6. searching of an element from the LinkedList
7. size of the LinkedList

stack supports last in first out order
means the element which is inserted at last will be popped out first

operations
-----------
1. Push --- inserted an element at top of the stack
2. pop ----- it means removing the topmost element from the stack
3. peep ---- returns the topmost element without deleting it.from the stack
4. searching operation--- knowing the position of an element in the stack
5. empty stack or not- - we can check a stack is if empty or not.
