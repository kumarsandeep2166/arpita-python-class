Array is an object that stores elements or group of elements of same type.
it only holds homogenous elements
it can be increased or decreased in size dynamically 
    which means we need not o declare or specify the size of array in python
so when an element is added it is stored to the last.
it occupies less memory in comparision to other data structures.
Execution of array is faster.
Array can grow and shrink in memory dynamically.
arrays are useful to handle a collection of elements like a group of numbers or group of characters.
methods or functions which can be applied to process the elements present inside array is present in "array" module
as it is present inside a module we have to import it while processing

Procedure
-----------
arrayname = array(type_code, [elements])

eg- x = array('i',[12,12,34,45,65,76,87])

type codes              c type                     minimum size in bytes
-------------         ---------------------       --------------------
'b'                  signed integer                   1
'B'                 unsigned integer                  1
'i'                   signed integer                  2
'I'                    unsigned integer               2
'l'                 signed integer                    4
'L'                  unsigned integer                 4
'f'                 floating point                    4
'd'                 double precision floating point   8
'u'                  unicode character                2

importing array module
----------------------
import array
a= array.array('i',[12,3,43,54,67,8])
b= array.array('u',['12','3','43','54','67','8'])

from array import *

a = array('i',[12,3,43,54,67,8])


processing of array
-------------------
a = array('i',[12,23,45,65,76,87,98,65])

function name                           description
-------------------------------------------------------
a.append(12)                    appends or adds the element to the last
a.count(x)                      counts the number of occurances of x
a.extends(x)                    x is another array, object, element appended at the extends
a.fromfile(f,n)                 reads n items or n number of characters from file f where f must be the file
                                object. it raises an EOFError if fewer than n items are present

a.fromlist(lst)                 it reads or appends items from list(lst) to the end of array. lst is the list
a.fromstring(s)                 it appends items from a string s to end of the array
a.index(x)                      calculates the position of x from the array.
a.insert(i,x)                   inserts x at i postion shifting the current element to the next
a.pop()                         it removes the last element
a.pop(x)                        it removes the x element from array
a.remove(x)                     it removes the first occurance of x in the array a
a.reverse()                     it reverses the array. last element comes to first and first goes to last
a.tofile(f)                     it concerts array "a" to file 'f'.
a.tolist()                      it converts array to list
a.tostring()                    it converts array to string

variables
---------
a.typecode                      represents the type of code character used to create the array
a.itemsize                      represents the size of items stored in the array in bytes

types of array
-----------------
single dimensional array
    arr = array('i',[12,45,46,43,56,35,46])
multi dimensional array
    arr = array([
        [12,23,34,54,65,76,87],
        [23,45,65,76,87,98,34],
        [12,45,67,87,98,76,87]
    ])
