Guido van Rossum
1991
Features
------------
1. Simple -- less stress on clarity about the programming structure.it is Just like reading english statements. Easy
2. Easy to learn -- The elegant style of coding makes easy to learn even complex applications. it has very less keywords
3. Open source -- no need to pay for python. it is freely available
4. High level language -- 
5. Dynamically Typed--- we need not to declare anything as everything is already predefinely declared.
                        An assignment statements binds to an object of particular type can be changed to another
                        changing the value only.
6. platform independent-- when a code is written in windows system is also same in mac or linux.
7. Portable - when a programming language gives same output in different environments it becomes Portable.
                Once a code is written , it can run in any platform and executed by 
                PVM(Python virtual machine)
8. Procedural as well as object Oriented --- python supports structured oriented programming 
                                            style that, programs are developed using functions and procedures.
                                            In case OOP use of classes and objects.

9. Interpreted -- Each program is executed line by line. It is the job of PVM to reach on every line to execute.
10. Extensible - python can communicate with other programming languages like C, java, C++.
                The programs written in other programming labguages can be integrated into python.
11. Embeddable -- we can also use python into other programming languages.
12. Huge Library --- python has a huge Library for different operating systems as programmers can develop 
                    applications using specific library.
13. Scripting Language-- 
14. Database Connectivity -- python can be used for Connectivity with any Database available in the world.
15. Scalable ---- it can be moved from one source to mutiple destinations.
